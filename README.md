# dict_with_GUI
A dictonary (the book one's) implementation in C , with GUI.

The dictionary implementation was an excercise at college ,now im adding a GUI ,to try working with GTK.

## HOW TO TEST (For linux)
Thing was implemented using gtk3 ,so you'll need it in order to run it.
```
	~$sudo install libgtk-3-0
```

Once you have the dependencies just hit:
```
	~$make
```
and everything should build.
